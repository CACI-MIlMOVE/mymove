# Factories

## Writing a new factory

Create and export a const called `{OBJECT_}FIELDS`. This constant should be an object whose keys are CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE and whose values are the actual, camelCase names of the fields, e.g. `MY_FIELD: myField`. While this step is not strictly necessary, it will make using your factory much easier, since the keys in question will be available to your IDE.

Create a const called `{object}Factory`, giving it a camelCase name. This const is a function that

- takes params
- returns a `baseFactory`, into which is passed an object containing
  - `fields`: the fields your factory returns
  - any other configuration passable to the `build()` functions [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jackfranklin/test-data-bot), such as `postBuild` or `traits`.
  - the spread params: `...params`.

Export your factory by default.

### Build and post-build

Factories generate data in two phases, the build and the post-build. Most values can be generated in the build phase. Use postBuild when the value of one field should be generated contingent upon the value of another.

### Fields

The fields object defines the structure and values of the object your factory will return. Values of this object can be literals, functions, or another object containing either.

```javascript
  [BASE_OBJECT.FIELDS]: {
    [OBJECT_FIELDS.FIELD_1]: 'value',
    [OBJECT_FIELDS.FIELD_2]: myCoolFunction,
    [OBJECT_FIELDS.FIELD_3]: {
      [SUBOBJECT_FIELDS.FIELD_1]: 'value',
    }
  }
```

#### Literals

If your field's value is a literal, the factory will always return that value. For example:

`field: 'my value'`

will always set the value of `field` to `'my value'` by default (i.e., unless)

#### Functions

Functions will be evaluated and the field set to their value. This is handy when a hardcoded value shouldn't be set, which is usually the case. You might generate an ID with a function, for example.

#### Objects

Fields can be set to objects and their values will be set recursively.

### Subfactories

If your object has fields that themselves can be generated by a factory, you can pass in a factory function as the value of that field:

`[OBJECT_FIELDS.SUBOBJECT_FIELD]: (args) => subobjectFactory(args)`

Be sure not to call the function, or its override features will not work.

### Traits

Traits are a way to set a number of fields at a time easily. The values of a trait's overrides will override any that the factory generates by default.

```javascript
[BASE_FIELDS.TRAITS]: {
    [OBJECT_TRAITS.MY_TRAIT]: {
      [BASE_FIELDS.OVERRIDES]: {
        [OBJECT_FIELDS.FIRST_FIELD_TO_OVERRIDE]: 'overrideValue',
        [OBJECT_FIELDS.SECOND_FIELD_TO_OVERRIDE]: 'overrideValue',
      }
    }
}
```

Note that the structure of these traits is the same as the object passed into a factory when it is actually called (see below).

Traits are used by setting the `useTraits` key to an array of traits when the factory is called, which are executed in order (see below).

### PostBuild

The postBuild function can be used to set values on the object based on other generated values.

```javascript
[BASE_FIELDS.FIELDS]: {
  [OBJECT_FIELDS.STATE]: getRandomState,
}
[BASE_FIELDS.POST_BUILD]: (object) => {
  object[OBJECT_FIELDS.POSTAL_CODE] = getPostalCodeFromState(object[OBJECT_FIELDS.STATE]);
}
```

## Using a factory for mocking test data

A factory can be used simply by calling it, which will return its default configuration.

`const object = objectFactory();`

A number of options are available to pass when a factory is called.

### Overrides

These are values set explicity on your object. The key is available via `BASE_FIELDS`:

```javascript
{
  [BASE_FIELDS.OVERRIDES]: {
    [MY_OBJECT_FIELDS.FIELD]: 'my value to override',
  }
}
```

### Traits

Use traits by setting the `useTraits` key to an array of traits. Traits are applied in order, overriding any default values, before postBuild is executed.

`{ [BASE_FIELDS.USE_TRAITS]: [MY_OBJECT_TRAITS.TRAIT_1, MY_OBJECT_TRAITS.TRAIT_2] }`

### Naming mock data

Because sure to prefix your test data with `mock`. Without the prefix, jest will complain about out-of-scope variables.

`const mockObject = objectFactory()`
