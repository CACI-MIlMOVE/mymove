        <h2 className="sm-heading">One move, several parts</h2>
        <p>
          It’s common to move some things yourself and have professional movers do the rest. You can also move things to
          or from more than one location.
        </p>
        <h2 className="sm-heading">Keep important things with you</h2>
        <p>
          It’s a smart idea to move essential items, heirlooms, and irreplaceable things yourself. Select a PPM
          (personally procured move) to do that.
        </p>
        <h2 className="sm-heading">Spread out your pickup dates</h2>
        <p>
          The easiest way to get the right boxes to the right location is to request different pickup and delivery days
          for different loads.
