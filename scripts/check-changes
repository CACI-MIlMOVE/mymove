# below and modify the string that you'd like to grep for. Make sure you escape
# any back-ticks "\`" in order to include them in your message. It's
# recommended you DO NOT add commands besides `echo` statements. This is
# because this command will run on everyone's machine whenever they perform a
# `git pull` and they may not want to run arbitrary commands. Also make sure
# you include a blank `echo` statement to allow for visual padding for the
# message, otherwise it bleeds in with the previous message and can be
